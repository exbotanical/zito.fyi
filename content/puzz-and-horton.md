It's been a while since I've written one of these. I realize that I maintain this sort of harmonic existential panic - albeit pretty subtle - that I am not writing enough. Specifically, I haven't in many years produced any sort of material artifact that documents the project of my personhood; who I am right now is in the minds of the very small number of people who know me well. I guess I want this to be here in case I die, or maybe so I can read it in ten years and play a game of remembering these exact minutes (or attempting to, anyway). My programs and code _are_ effectively one such artifact, but the interpretation thereof also warrants its own artifact, and I'm too lazy and too busy to write a whole epistemology about my own programming.

So I've reconvened on a resolution to use this damned blog thing and write. It's good practice, at least.

This last month, I've fallen into a jigsaw puzzle fixation. It began when Daryl and I took my dad and his wife to the Chuly (TODO:) Glass Museum in Seattle. They've a gift shop which I presumed would be akin to any other museum gift shop - perhaps a few ostensibly interesting objects which quickly lose their allure courtesy heavy price tags. I was surprised, then, to find reasonable tickets on many items and moreover to find objects that I really, _really_, REALLY liked. Specifically, these little wooden robots that fold into cubes called Cubebots. Cubebots are puzzle/sculptures - the designer, David Weeks, has created something like 30 different designs thereof. I love tiny objects and I love puzzles, so these caught my eye.

I ended up acquiring 4 of them via various venues. Namely, I found a design store called Areaware for which David Weeks made the Cubebots. Areaware also sells jigsaw puzzles in collaboration with various design artists. One such series, Bryce Wilner's Gradient Puzzles, feature - hence the name - various bichromatic or trichromatic gradients in 100, 500, or 1000 pieces. A few Ebay purchases later and I've completed several Areaware puzzles. Here's my Cubebots:

And here's some of the puzzles I've completed thus far:
